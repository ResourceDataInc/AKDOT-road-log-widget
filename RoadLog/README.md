# Overlay Events widget
The Overlay Events widget for Web AppBuilder works with the Esri Roads and Highways and ArcGIS Pipeline Referencing extensions for ArcGIS Enterprise.

This is a developer sample.

The Overlay Events widget allows you to dynamically segment events together into one feature layer. Users can dynamically segment a whole route or just a section of a route when measures are provided. Users can type in route and measure values or use the map to select a route and measures.

## Instructions
Deploying Widgets

To use the widget with Web AppBuilder, you should copy the OverlayEvents folder to the stemapp/widgets directory. This is located in %webappbuilder_install%/client directory.

For more resources on developing or modifying widgets please visit
[Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/web-appbuilder/)

Add a linear referencing enabled map service to the webmap to enable the widget. The LRS map service should be published with a definition query for time.

When configuring the widget, leave 'Measure Precision' blank to use the measure precision configured for the network.
